        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I'm a self taught Web Developer who has put in countless hours perfecting my craft and educating myself while working full time as a Deputy Sheriff for my county. I have successfully completed "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" - by Angela Yu, which covers HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, React.js and more! I've also completed the "JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2023" and "React - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzmuller. I have good understanding for design and development and am really eager to showcase my skills! I look forward to being apart of your team! </p>

        <h3>Image Design</h3>
        <p>I have worked on numerous photoshop projects which can be provided upon request or as seen on GitHub. I have always had a love for creating new logos and have been diving into 3D design as well. I am a very quick learner and would be an extremely valuable asset to any team or company, which I could provide any sort of design needed for.</p>
